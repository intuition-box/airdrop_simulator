# Intuition Airdrop Checker

The checker gives an estimated allocation for the upcoming $TRUST Airdrop from [0xintuition](https://x.com/0xIntuition)

# Assumptions

The first thing was total IQ points ever distributed, couldnâ€™t find it from any source, so I had to do some calculation. For this, I tracked atoms with account tag in Intuition Portal. It was noticed that all atoms were created by some 0x4ff2d2d253827897210bf1f29713f8389f55c68e

So I used the graphql Url to get some random account clusters and calculate the average 

```
url = "https://testnet.intuition.sh/v1/graphql"

query = """
query GetAccountAtoms($limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
  terms(
    where: { type: { _eq: "Atom" }, atom: { type: { _eq: "Account" } } }
    limit: $limit
    offset: $offset
  ) {
    atom {
      data
    }
  }
}
```

The each cluster was of around 80-90 size and the average IQ per wallet in each cluster is as below

So, I took an average of 600K IQs per wallet (probably too generous ðŸ˜†) and for total address, there were around 244K Beta participants, though in testnet, there were **898.8K Active** accounts (as per the website) but not all testnet users had IQ points, so I took an estimation of 350K wallets.

Also, for airdrop Allocation, I assumed, there will be 8% during the genesis drop. And for NFT multiplier, I assigned some multiplier based on rank, and those who had more than 1 NFT, their multiplier was calculated based on square root of summation of all the multiplier (see attached)

The NFT data were obtained from Opensea API

And the IQ points were collected from Intuitionâ€™s API

Another important thing which was considered is that accounts without any IQ points are ineligible
