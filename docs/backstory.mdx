# A Tribute to the Origins of the Intuition Airdrop

Welcome to the **Intuition Airdrop Simulator** — a playful yet meaningful homage to the early days of our community.

This initiative was born out of a simple idea: to align the community’s expectations around what an airdrop could look like.  
To spark that conversation, I decided to host a **fun “ride-selling” contest**. I announced it one morning… and within just a few hours, **50 incredible submissions** poured in from our most creative and passionate “truckers.”

These early contributions weren’t just fun; they shaped the DNA of Intuition.  
Many of the best ideas that emerged during that contest have since found their way into the Intuition ecosystem.  
The spirit of experimentation, openness, and collaboration that defined those first 50 truckers continues to guide us today.

This simulator is both a **tool and a tribute** — celebrating those pioneers who helped us imagine what the Intuition airdrop could be.  
It’s a space for everyone to participate, to explore scenarios, and to honor the creativity that brought us here.

**We invite you to join in.**  
Play with the simulator, share your thoughts, and help shape the next chapter of Intuition.
