# A Tribute to the Origins of the Intuition Airdrop

This initiative was born from a simple idea: explore the community's expectations for what the $TRUST airdrop could look like.

To spark that conversation, I hosted a "small" **vibe-coding contest**.

A big part of the experiment was also to draw attention to the role of **relics** in the upcoming airdrop. The Intuition team had already hinted at their importance, and this challenge was the perfect way to show how these artifacts could reward early participation.
