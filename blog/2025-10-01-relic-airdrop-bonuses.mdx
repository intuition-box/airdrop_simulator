In a fresh update, Intuition unpacked how relics amplify the forthcoming $TRUST airdrop.

**Key takeaways** : 
<br />

- Relics act as bonus pools layered on top of base IQ points; owning relics directly increases $TRUST allocations via 
```
TOTAL IQ = (Portal IQ × Relic multiplier) + Relics bonus
```
```
Multiplier range : 1.5X to 4X
```
```
Bonus / Relic  : 500k to 25M IQs
```

- Bonuses stack across rarities and editions—genesis relics provide larger boosts than their non-genesis counterparts.
<br />
- The team showcased a detailed chart breaking down bonuses per rarity (Common → Mystic) and the distinction between Genesis and regular relics.
